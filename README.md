Swift package plugins for Apple's [swift-format](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format) formatting tools.

## Note

This package depends on the `swift-format` installation [included](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format?tab=readme-ov-file#included-in-the-swift-toolchain) in the Swift toolchain with Swift 6 and higher.

## Installation

SwiftFormatPlugins is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to **File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency...** and enter package repository URL **https://github.com/StarLard/SwiftFormatPlugins.git**, then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open **Swift Packages** (which is next to **Build Settings**). You can add and remove packages from this tab.

> Swift Package Manager can also be used [from the command line](https://swift.org/package-manager/).
